# 3D Printable Parts
123D Design and STL files for a console case and stand.  Printed successfully in ABS.  All screws are metric M2.5.  The short screws that hold the Pi to the case are 12 mm.  The long screws that hold the display are 28mm.  The screws that are used in the stand are also 12mm.  The screws that secure the lid are 10mm but 12s would probably also work fine.
